# Service workers and caching in vanilla js

This introduces newbies and existing web developers to service workers and caching.

A service worker is a script that your browser runs in the background, separate from a web page, opening the door to features that don't need a web page or user interaction. A service worker helps developers implement features like push notifications, background sync and caching.
